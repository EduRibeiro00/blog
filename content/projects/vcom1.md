* Developed system that calculates the 3D coordinates of points in an image lit by a shadow plane, by using structured light techniques.
* Implemented all necessary stages in the process, including the camera calibration process, the light projection system calibration, the edge and line detection algorithms and the final calculation of 3D coordinates.
