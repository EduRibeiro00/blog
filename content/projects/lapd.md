* Developed a tool capable of extracting and analyzing energy related data from various sources, detecting high growth opportunities within the energy market and industry, and showcase that information to the user in a 3D graph interface.
* Extracted the most up-to-date news and information about the energy market by using the Usearch API and social media APIs from Reddit and Twitter.
* Defined and collected data for several energy sectors by using the [Open Energy Ontology (OEO)](https://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/) to recognize energy-related areas and concepts.
