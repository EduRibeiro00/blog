* Developed a distributed peer-to-peer system in the Internet that allows the backup of a file divided in chunks in other peers; also allows the restoration and deletion of a file, and the reclaim of a peer's personal space.
* Protected the system against faults and raised its stability and scalability by using and implementing the Chord Protocol.
* Assured the privacy and integrity of the messages, and increased system security by implementing secure communication channels with JSSE.
* Achieved high degrees of concurrency and parallelism by using thread-pools and non-blocking I/O.
