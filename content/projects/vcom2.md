* Developed a system that can perform classification of images, applied in this case to the artwork collection dataset provided by the [Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York](https://www.kaggle.com/metmuseum/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-open-access).
* Implemented several methods and techniques to solve the problem, like using a Bag of Words descriptor + classifier, and using Convolutional Neural Networks.
* Evaluated the performance of each method using relevant metrics, and discussed the results.
