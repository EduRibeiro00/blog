* Developed a platform to foster energy analytics for R&D institutions, by automating energy and weather data collection and management.
* Automated energy data collection by creating scripts that periodically fetch data from APIs of electricity data sources in Europe.
* Implemented detection of missing values by creating software that monitors DB with 130+ tables, each one with an average of 3 million rows.
* Allowed registered users to extract desired data by building an authentication layer and a REST API, and by helping create a user interface.
* Organized and presented a hands-on workshop for the INESC TEC Power and Energy Systems team, to showcase the tool for their future usage.
